# A* Algorithm implementation

This is a p5 js project to visually analyse how the A* algorithm works.

This is a sort of adaptation of the staright forward wikipedia algorithm.

It could be better implemented (searching arrays etc etc) however this was a
quick hatch up representation of the A* algorithm.

If you have any changes, make a pull request and explain your changes.. That
will be appreciated. 


## To run this project:

* Clone / Download the project
* Open index.html in a browser of your choice (preferably chrome or something like that)
