This is a p5 js project to visually analyse how the A* algorithm works.

This is a sort of adaptation of the staright forward wikipedia algorithm.

It could be better implemented (searching arrays etc etc) however this was a
quick hatch up representation of the A* algorithm.

If you have any changes, make a pull request and explain your changes.. That
will be appreciated.
